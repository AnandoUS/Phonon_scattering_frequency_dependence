# Phonon_scattering_frequency_dependence
Script to parse ShengBTE outputfiles to check the frequency dependence of scattering rates and calculate the analytical Gruneisen parameter.

Based on Klemens analytical expression the script back-calculates an analytical gruneisen parameter as a function of frequency. This analytical gruneisen should be essentially frequency independent if the ShengBTE scattering rates have a omega^2 frequency dependence. Example files of CoSb3 are provided.
